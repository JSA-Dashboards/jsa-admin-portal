"""
futures_spread.py — Futures prices / spreads for anchoring forward basis curves.

Each delivery's basis is quoted against its OWN futures month (June vs ZSN, the
new-crop vs ZSX, etc.).  To draw a meaningful forward BASIS curve, every point is
re-expressed against ONE anchor month (the spot/front month) by adding the
futures spread between that delivery's month and the anchor:

    cash            = futures(row_symbol)  + raw_basis
    anchored_basis  = cash - futures(anchor_symbol)
                    = raw_basis + futures(row_symbol) - futures(anchor_symbol)

So the only external input needed is a futures price (cents/bu) per CME symbol.

Source: `adm_futures.fetch_futures_curve()` harvests these prices for free from
ADM's own Gradable feed (each instrument carries the underlying futures price +
symbol). The app loads that curve behind a cache and calls `set_curve()`; any
symbol not in the curve returns None and that point falls back to raw basis.
