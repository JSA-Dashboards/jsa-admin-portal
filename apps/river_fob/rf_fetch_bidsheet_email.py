fetch_bidsheet_email.py — INTERIM desktop fetcher.

Finds Doug Schultz's daily **Bid Sheet** emails in Outlook (via Outlook COM, like
vessel-lineup's fetcher), grabs each .xlsx attachment, and upserts its CIF +
barge-freight into the River FOB Snowflake archive via `bidsheet`.

This is the desktop stop-gap (no IT needed). The droplet/Graph version will
replace it once Graph `Mail.Read` is granted (see deploy/IT_REQUEST_mail_read.md);
both front-ends call the same `bidsheet.save_bidsheet()`.

Windows Task `RiverFobBidSheetImport` runs it every 10 minutes, 3:00-7:00 PM CT on
weekdays (Doug's sheet lands in the afternoon: 2:09-5:51 PM over 10/01-10/07), so a
sheet is archived within ~10 min of arriving, or at 3:00 if it came earlier:
    C:\\Python314\\python.exe "<repo>\\fetch_bidsheet_email.py"
Needs: pywin32 (Outlook COM), the repo .env (USE_SNOWFLAKE + SNOWFLAKE_*).

CATCH-UP (2026-10-12). On Fri 10/09 every run crashed before saving, and by Monday
the sheet was past the 120 newest mails this used to look at, so the day stayed
missing until loaded by hand. Now each run takes every Bid Sheet received since
the day after the last one it handled (LAST_DONE), going back at most
CATCHUP_DAYS, and saves the days that aren't archived yet, oldest first:
  - today's sheet takes the live CBOT board from Massive (between the 1:20 close
    and the 7 PM reopen, that's the close);
  - a past day's sheet, or today's after 7 PM, takes THAT day's settlement from
    Massive's daily session bars. The live board can't give it. The basis
    tracker's FUTURES_PRICES isn't used: it was a day off until its 2026-10-12
    fix, and its row for today can still be a provisional close (bidsheet._closing_board).
A day already archived (e.g. pasted by hand) is never overwritten unless --force.
LAST_DONE only moves past a day once it's handled, so a failed day is retried.
Most polls still exit early: once today is handled, or when no new sheet has come
in, a run neither scans far nor queries Snowflake.

LOG. Every run appends to logs/bidsheet_import.log (rotated; gitignored), with the
full traceback if it crashes. Task Scheduler keeps none of the output. Exit codes:
0 = done / nothing to do, 1 = crash, 2 = a day couldn't get its futures (the save
was refused; the next run retries).
