"""
fetch_bidsheet_email.py — INTERIM desktop fetcher.

Finds Doug Schultz's newest daily **Bid Sheet** email in Outlook (via Outlook
COM, like vessel-lineup's fetcher), grabs the .xlsx attachment, and upserts its
CIF + barge-freight into the River FOB Snowflake archive via `bidsheet`.

This is the desktop stop-gap (no IT needed). The droplet/Graph version will
replace it once Graph `Mail.Read` is granted (see deploy/IT_REQUEST_mail_read.md);
both front-ends call the same `bidsheet.save_bidsheet()`.

Windows Task `RiverFobBidSheetImport` runs it every 10 minutes, 3:00-7:00 PM CT on
weekdays (Doug's sheet lands in the afternoon: 2:09-5:51 PM over 10/01-10/07), so a
sheet is archived within ~10 min of arriving, or at 3:00 if it came earlier:
    C:\\Python314\\python.exe "<repo>\\fetch_bidsheet_email.py"
Most polls exit early on a local note of the last sheet handled (LAST_DONE).
Needs: pywin32 (Outlook COM), the repo .env (USE_SNOWFLAKE + SNOWFLAKE_*).
Pass --force to re-save a date that's already archived (e.g. a corrected sheet).

By default the save REFUSES to commit unless the live CBOT board pulled from
Massive (so a Massive blip can't archive a carry-less day); it exits 2 so the
task is flagged and the next run retries. Pass --allow-no-futures to override
and save CIF/freight only.
