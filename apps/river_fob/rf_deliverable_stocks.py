"""Deliverable Stocks — CBOT corn and soybean stocks in deliverable positions ("visible stocks in delivery space"), weekly.

Kolten 2026-10-21: "Can we add these as a tab and update them as they do on CME website? Make the look similar ... Call it Deliverable
Stocks ... put it on the cash vs DVE tab ... below the cash vs DVE chart."

Source: CME's weekly "Stocks of Grain" report (as of FRIDAY, published the following TUESDAY by noon CT). CME's Data Terms of Use bar
scripts that retrieve or harvest cmegroup.com and compiling or redistributing its data without written consent, so NOTHING here
downloads it: the weekly totals are typed in on the Cash vs Del tab (editors only) until CME licenses its Stocks of Grain DataMine
dataset to JSA, when a DataMine job can write the same table. History before that comes from the old FOB Sheet workbook's
'Deliverable Stox' tab (2020 on), loaded once by `import_deliverable_stocks.py`.

Storage: `deliverable_stocks` in the portal's own database (RIVER_FOB.PUBLIC on Snowflake), one row per (as_of Friday, commodity):
stocks in THOUSAND bushels, the source ('workbook' | 'manual' | 'datamine'). Pure helpers for the charts are below the storage.
