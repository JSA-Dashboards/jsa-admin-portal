"""Parse the daily **Bid Sheet** Excel (Doug Schultz's forwarded email) into the
River FOB archive.

The workbook's **'Bid Sheet'** tab, cells A1:T16, carries the barge-freight and
CIF NOLA tables; **A1 is the as-of date**. This module is email-source-agnostic:
hand `save_bidsheet()` a path to the .xlsx and it parses + writes to Snowflake.
The email fetch (Outlook COM on the desktop, or Graph on the droplet) is a thin
front-end that just produces the file, then calls this.

Layout (1-indexed columns on the 'Bid Sheet' tab):
  A        month label (TW/NW are spot rows, skipped; then Sept..Apr)
  B..I     barge freight, already the tariff multiplier (7.75 == 775%):
           B ILL->IL, C OHIO->Ohio, D L OHIO (ignored, dup of OHIO),
           E MM->Davenport South+McGregor South, F CITIES->Upper Miss,
           G STL->STL, H MTCT->Lower Miss, I ARK (ignored, not a FOB region)
  M/N O/P Q/R S/T   CIF value + contract letter for CORN / MILO(ignored) /
           BEANS / WHEAT; CIF is cents -> $/bu (/100).
Blank cells are closed reaches / absent months and are simply skipped.
