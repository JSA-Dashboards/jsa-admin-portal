"""net_carry_data.py - the adapter between the River FOB sheet and the vendored Net Carry modules.

The Net Carry logic (net_carry.py, net_carry_chart.py, net_carry_compare.py, carry_rate.py) is copied
unchanged from the basis tracker (see sync_carry_modules.py there). It reads a location's forward curve as
    items = [{'delivery': 'Oct 2026', 'futures': 'ZCZ26', 'basis': -6.2}]      (basis in CENTS/bu)
    curve = {'ZCZ26': 497.5, ...}                                              (futures in CENTS/bu)
and this module builds both from what the river sheet stores. Pure functions only (no Streamlit, no DB),
so every step can be unit-tested; the app hands in the sheet's columns, CBOT row and FOB row. The one exception
is `futures_history` at the bottom (the Return to Carry section's futures settlements from the basis tracker's
FUTURES_PRICES): its query goes through an injectable `rows_fn`, so the tests run it against a throwaway SQLite.

How the sheet maps onto the module's inputs
  * DELIVERY. A sheet column is a calendar MONTH label ('Oct', 'July', 'Sept', older sheets also 'Spot') and has
    no year. The window rolls forward from the as-of month (fob_model.months_for), so the first month gets the
    year that puts it at/near the sheet's date and every later column is the next such month ('Jan' after
    'Dec' is next year). A 'Spot' column is the prompt bid in the as-of month. Each delivery is handed over as
    'Oct 2026' / 'Spot Oct 2026' - an explicit year, because delivery_period would otherwise guess it from
    the futures contract (wrong for a Jan delivery quoted off last December's contract).
  * FUTURES. The sheet carries one contract code per column ('CZ', 'SX', 'WH'; prefix = commodity, last
    letter = CME month code) and one CBOT price per column (the same contract repeats its price). The code has
    no year either, so the contract is the occurrence of that month letter NEAREST the delivery month (from
    5 months before to 6 after): Oct 2026 + 'CZ' -> ZCZ26; Dec 2026 + 'SF' -> ZSF27 (soybean Jan); Dec 2023 +
    'CH' -> ZCH24; and a sheet that quotes Oct 2025 off the Sept contract still reads ZCU25, not ZCU26.
    Roots: Corn ZC, Soybeans ZS, Wheat ZW (Chicago SRW - the river sheet's wheat, see massive_futures.PRODUCT).
  * UNITS. FOB and the CBOT row are $/bu on the sheet; both go to the module in cents (x100).
  * NO GUESSING. A sheet with no usable futures, or whose month labels don't line up with its date (stale
    headers on a handful of 2025 sheets), comes back with a plain-language `problem` and no items.
